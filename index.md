Highlights

    31% higher cache hit rate with compressed multi‑level cache RTL; validated with Intel Pin traces.

    Achieved ~800 MHz on Intel Stratix‑10 MX/NX; improved DSP datapath and DMA throughput by ~20%.

    Integrated 2‑bit, gselect, and gshare predictors in 5‑stage RISC‑V; ~17% performance uplift.
